                When it comes to the mental health treatment journey, a critical aspect of your 
                healing is how connected you feel to your provider. Have you ever tried going to 
                a therapist just to feel disconnected and ultimately quit going? Or maybe you were 
                simply just looking for a therapist and became overwhelmed with the sheer number of 
                options out there. Well, we can promise you that you're not alone. Unfortunately, 
                finding the ideal therapist ends up being much like dating around. The issue, though, 
                is that feeling a disconnect in therapy only continues to affect us in the long run. 
              </p>
              <p class="pb-6">​
                Our goal is to enable you to not only enlist in therapy but to have a successful 
                experience. To do that, we first need you to complete an online Myers & Briggs 
                personality test.  Here’s the logic - research has shown that certain combinations 
                of personalities have a higher likelihood of forming a positive connection. For example, 
                if your results show that you are a Sensing Judger (ex: ESTJ), you may benefit from a 
                pairing with a mental health provider who is also a Sensing Judger (ex: ISFJ) because 
                when paired together, Sensing Judgers have a 79% success rate in getting along (1). 
                High connection success rates can be seen with various personality pairings. 
              </p>
              <p class="pb-6">
                We don’t stop at pairing you with your personality match, though! To ensure 
                that you’re receiving optimal care, we are also connecting you based on your 
                experiences. When independently searching for a mental health provider it’s 
                important to review the counselor's areas of expertise, so we made sure to 
                include that in your connection as well. In our survey, we will ask you to 
                share your experiences and area(s) of concern. We will then use our intelligent 
                algorithm to compare your background with the professional experiences of therapists 
                in our database to pair you with a provider who has experience in working with 2 or 
                more of your area(s) of concern. For this reason, we ask that you share as much as you 
                are comfortable sharing. The more information we have about you, the closer the match 
                we will be able to find.
              </p>
              <p class="pb-6">
                We will also be sure to inquire about your preferences, so we can connect you with 
                a mental health provider with whom you will feel comfortable sharing with. 
              </p>
              <p class="pb-6">
                Combined with an environment where you feel culturally seen, we feel these factors 
                will help to foster the optimal ambiance for healing. In this setting, you will 
                feel enabled to share more, communicate more, and start saying more.
